Git is the most common way to track changes in software projects. Github.com is the most popular place to store such *repositories* (for free) and they are a great way of backing up your code and (<100Mb) output files. Some knowledge of the command-line is required and basics are covered here.

## Creating a github repo for your FFF project

To get yourself a personal copy of the workshop materials, and get a workspace to keep your work in use the https://github.com/xchem/FFF_Workshop as a *template* for a new repository:
